# Unpopular Opinions

This is a list of works of media where the general consensus is that it is very good or very bad, but for which I disagree. For every piece of media listed here, I have personally consumed the media (i.e. read the book, watched the movie, played the videogame, etc.) and have formed my own opinion of it.


## Idiosyncracities about my rating scale

<details>
  <summary>[expand/collapse]</summary>

Many reviewers online use a very skewed rating system. Some video game review sites are notorious for having "8 out of 10" be the worst score they've give nout and "9.5 out of 10" be their highest, for example. I think review scores are more useful if they are normally distributed. I'm assuming axiomatically that the quality of the works of media out there is distributed normally, and so it would be "good" if the review scores were also distributed the same way so as to reflect the quality of the work as closely as possible.

Internally, I like to review things in terms of standard deviations, where a score of 0 means an average piece of work, a score of -1 means a somewhat below average piece of work, a score of -2 means a significantly below average piece of work, a score of 1 means a somewhat above average piece of work, and a score of 2 means a significantly above average piece of work. I find that if I just directly report these scores, people misunderstand what it means (for example, they might think a score of 0 means that I think the work is bad). So instead, I translate this score into a 1 to 5 scale, by basically mapping -2 to 1, -1 to 2, 0 to 3, 1 to 4 and 2 to 5. I.e. the score I report on this site is (essentially) their standard deviation plus three.
  
Works of media that are below or above 2 standard deviations from the mean are rare enough that I can just map them to 1 or 5 respectively to get the message across without too much loss of information.
  
Based on [the analysis performed by a data scientist](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/whose-reviews-should-you-trust-imdb-rotten-tomatoes-metacritic-or-fandango-7d1010c6cf19/), IMDB is slightly skewed towards positive, Fandango is strongly skewed towards positive, MetaCritic is pretty normally distributed, and Rotten Tomatoes is uniformly distributed. Since my rating system is normally distributed, I will report scores from MetaCritic when reporting what the general consensus opinion is on a work so that the two rating systems are most easily comparable.

## Movies

<details>
  <summary><b>The Human Centipede (First Sequence)</b>. 2009. Consensus: 1.7/5; My opinion: 2.5/5</summary>
  
This movie is a pretty average thriller with body horror elements. It's not clear to me why it got as many bad reviews as it did. My suspicion is that the premise (of sewing people's mouths to other people's anuses) was disturbing enough that many reviews wished to socially punish the movie (or signal that they wish to socially punish the movie) by giving it a significantly lower rating than it deserves.
  
Note that when discussing the topic of this film, people like to quote Roger Ebert as saying "I am required to award stars to movies I review. This time, I refuse to do it. The star rating system is unsuited to this film. Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine." in an attempt to push the narrative that the movie is so bad, Ebert refused to give it a star review, that the movie was beneath even 0 stars. However, I think this is a misrpresentation of [Ebert's review](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-human-centipede-2010), which also contains the following:

> And yet within Six \[the director of the movie\], there stirs the soul of a dark artist. He treats his material with utter seriousness; there's none of the jokey undertone of a classic Hammer horror film like “Scream … and Scream Again” (1970), in which every time the victim awoke, another limb had been amputated. That one starred the all-star trio of Vincent Price, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, and you could see they were having fun. Dieter Laser, who plays Dr. Heiter, takes the role with relentless sincerity. This is his 63rd acting role, but, poor guy, is seemingly the one he was born to play.

> [...]

> I have long attempted to take a generic approach. In other words, is a film true to its genre and does it deliver what its audiences presumably expect? “The Human Centipede” scores high on this scale. It is depraved and disgusting enough to satisfy the most demanding midnight movie fan. And it's not simply an exploitation film.
>
> The director makes, for example, effective use of the antiseptic interior of Heiter's labyrinthine home. Doors and corridors lead nowhere and anywhere. In a scene where the police come calling, Six wisely has Heiter almost encourage their suspicions. And there is a scene toward the end, as the Human Centipede attempts escape, that's so piteous, it transcends horror and approaches tragedy.
  
I read this as him largely agreeing with my take: it's delivers exactly what you would want for its genre, and the director and cast did their jobs seriously, with an intent to make this a good movie. It didn't end up being a great movie, but it didn't end up being a bad one either. It's simply an average movie with an unusual premise.
  
Many of the criticisms of the movie are apt: the pacing of the scenes is pretty meh. The characters are idiotic and don't escape when they have the chance. The writing isn't particularly witty or intelligent. But that's precisely how most thrillers are, which is why this movie deserves an average score, not a low score.
  
Note that if you're specifically into body horror porn or corprophilia, then this movie will likely disappoint you, because there isn't much of that content there. The person in the front segment *says* they need to poop, and the person in the middle segment sobs and moans in disgust, but you don't actually *see* anything happen. It's all left your imagination. It certainly did not come off as a sexploitation film, nor a pornographic one. The sewn-together characters are topless (they wore some sort of boxer-short/briefs hybrid to cover their bottoms), but the camera angles were such that there was never a nipple visible. If you ignore the context and just consider what body parts were visible, this could easily have been a PG13 film.
